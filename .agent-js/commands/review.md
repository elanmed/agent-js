Run `git diff` and `git diff --staged` to get all uncommitted changes.

Review the diff and provide feedback on:

1. Bugs or logic errors
2. Edge cases that aren't handled
3. Naming or readability concerns
4. Any inconsistencies with surrounding code patterns

Be specific. Reference file names and line context. Skip praise and skip anything that looks fine. Only mention issues worth fixing.
